# Product Bundles - Variation Bundles for WooCommerce

### What's This?

Free mini-extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/?aff=46147&cid=5699243) that allows you to map variations to static Product Bundles.

Useful if you, for example:

* Want to bundle together Hoodies and T-Shirts, and need a way to let customers choose their **Size** once, and then add the right Bundle to their cart.
* Are selling wine in bottles, boxes or pallets, and have created the box and pallet using Product Bundles. Now, you need a way to let customers choose a single bottle, a box, or a pallet.

### How It Works

Once a variation has been mapped to a Product Bundle, customers who click the add-to-cart button after choosing its attributes will see the mapped Bundle in their cart, instead of the selected variation.

### Notes

Before installing this plugin, please ensure that you are running the latest versions of both **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Product Bundles**.
