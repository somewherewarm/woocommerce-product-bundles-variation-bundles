Free mini-extension for WooCommerce Product Bundles that allows you to map Bundles to variations. Once a Product Bundle has been mapped to a variation, customers who click the add-to-cart button after choosing the variation's attributes will find the mapped Bundle in their cart, instead of the selected variation.


== Description ==

Free mini-extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) that allows you to map variations to static Product Bundles.

Useful if you, for example:

* Want to bundle together Hoodies and T-Shirts, and need a way to let customers choose their **Size** once, and then add the right Bundle to their cart.
* Are selling wine in bottles, boxes or pallets, and have created the box and pallet using Product Bundles. Now, you need a way to let customers choose a single bottle, a box, or a pallet.

**Important**: This plugin requires the official [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/) extension. Before installing this plugin, please ensure that you are running the latest versions of both **WooCommerce** and **WooCommerce Product Bundles**.
